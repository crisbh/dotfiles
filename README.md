Repo with the dotfiles I use in my own machine. These aim at setting up a smooth workflow for daily work.

My current setup includes:

- OS: `Linux Fedora`
- shell: `zsh`
- terminal: `kitty`
- editor: `nvim`
  - I currently use a lua-based neovim configuration based on my fork of [AstroNvim](https://github.com/crisbh/AstroNvim.git). This comes with sensible defaults and option to easily get IDE-like features through `LSP`, `telescope`, etc.
- `tmux`
