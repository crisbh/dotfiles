# dotfiles

Repo with the dotfiles I use in my own machine. These try to provide a good
experience for day to day work.

My current setup includes:

- OS: `Linux Fedora`
- shell: `zsh`
- terminal: `kitty`
- editor: `nvim`
- `tmux`

At the moment, I have moved to a lua-based neovim configuration based on my fork
of [AstroNvim][https://github.com/crisbh/AstroNvim.git].
